1. Preheat the oven to 475°F and line a medium baking dish with parchment paper. Coat the bottom with about a **¼-inch layer of salt**, then place the **whole carrots** in the dish and sprinkle with a good amount of **salt.**
2. Roast the carrots until easily pierced with a fork, but not mushy. The timing will depend on the size and freshness of your carrots. Check them, starting around 40 minutes.
3. Make the marinade: In a shallow dish or small bowl, combine the **olive oil**, **rice vinegar**, **paprika**, **lemon juice**, and several grinds of **black pepper**.
4. Remove the carrots from the oven and let cool. Use your hands to rub off any excess salt. Use a knife to slice a thin strip off one side of the salty skin, and then use a peeler to peel the carrot into ribbons.
5. Place the strips in the marinade and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator and marinate for 15-30 minutes.
