1. Place **1 cup dried black beans** (no need to soak) in a colander and rinse under cold running water. Combine black beans, **1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil**, and 5 cups water in a large saucepan or small pot. Bring to boil over high heat and cook 15 minutes.
2. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer beans, checking occasionally and adding more water if needed to keep covered, until tender but not mushy, 1½–2 hours. Squeeze a bean between your fingers to test.
3. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop **1 small onion**; set aside for mayi moulen. Thinly slice **3 scallions**. Smash **5 garlic cloves** with the side of chef’s knife, peel, and finely chop. Remove leaves from **5 sprigs parsley** and **4 sprigs thyme** and coarsely chop; discard stems.
4. Purée most but not all of the beans in pan with an immersion blender (or, transfer about half of the beans to a regular blender and blend until mostly smooth; mix back into beans in pan).
5. Heat **1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil** in a small skillet over medium. Cook scallions and a little less than half of the garlic, stirring often, until starting to brown, about 4 minutes. Scrape into beans, then add half of the parsley, half of the thyme, **½ cup unsweetened coconut milk**, and **2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt**. Press **3 whole cloves** into **1 Scotch bonnet or habanero chile** (this will make them easy to find later!) and add chile to pot; bring bean mixture to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to thicken (but don’t cook so aggressively that chile breaks open), 15–20 minutes. Sos pwa nwa should still be loose enough to spread on a plate. Thin with water if needed. Taste and season with more salt as needed. Carefully fish out and discard chile.
6. Meanwhile, make the mayi moulen: Heat remaining **1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil** in a Dutch oven over medium. Cook reserved onion and remaining garlic, stirring often, until starting to turn golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add 4 cups water and bring to a boil.
7. Whisking constantly, gradually sprinkle in **1 cup cornmeal**, then add remaining thyme, remaining parsley, and remaining **1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt**. Cook, stirring constantly, until starting to thicken, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cover pot. Cook, stirring vigorously every 5 minutes or so, until cornmeal is velvety smooth and no longer gritty, 18–25 minutes. Taste mayi moulen and season with more salt if needed.
8. Thinly slice **1 avocado**. Remove leaves from another **1–2 sprigs parsley** and coarsely chop. Mound mayi moulen on plates, then ladle sos pwa nwa next to it, letting it spread. Top with avocado slices and chopped parsley.
