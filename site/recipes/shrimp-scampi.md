1. Thaw that shrimp! Place unopened **1-lb. bag of shrimp** in a large bowl and fill with cool water. Place a heavy plate on top to submerge until thawed, about 45 minutes. Pat them dry before proceeding. Season shrimp with **1 tsp. salt**. Let sit until ready to use. While all that's happening, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

2. Peel **1 medium onion**, then finely chop so that all pieces are about the size of lentils. Transfer to a medium bowl. Using a Microplane, grate **5 garlic cloves** right into bowl. Finely grate zest of **½ lemon** right into bowl. Coarsely chop **1 cup parsley leaves with tender stems**; transfer to a separate small bowl and set aside.

3. Heat **¾ cup panko**, **2 Tbsp. olive oil**, and **¼ tsp. salt** in a large Dutch oven over medium, stirring to coat panko.

4. Grate remaining **2 garlic cloves** into pot and stir to combine. Cook, stirring often, until panko is golden brown, 3–4 minutes. Transfer panko mixture to a small bowl. Let cool. Wipe out any panko stuck to bottom of pot.

5. Heat **2 Tbsp. olive oil** in pot over medium-high until just beginning to shimmer and you can see wisps of smoke. Cook shrimp, undisturbed, until golden brown on the underside, 2–3 minutes. Turn with tongs and continue to cook until shrimp is barely cooked through, about 15 seconds longer (the shrimp will keep cooking as it sits, and we’re going to add them back into the pot later so they’ll get a chance to finish cooking there—err on the side of undercooked). Transfer shrimp to a plate.

6. Add onion mixture, **4 Tbsp. butter**, **1 tsp. salt**, and **½ tsp. red pepper flakes** to pot and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until very fragrant and softened but not browned, about 2 minutes.

7. Add **¾ cup dry white wine** and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid evaporates, some of the harsh alcohol scent cooks off, and sauce is thick and glossy, 2–3 minutes. Remove from heat while you cook the pasta.

8. Drop **1 lb. fettuccine** in boiling water and set a timer according to package directions for al dente. Scoop out 1½ cups pasta cooking liquid.

9. Drain pasta and add to Dutch oven along with reserved pasta cooking liquid and remaining **4 Tbsp. butter** and **2 Tbsp. olive oil**. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until well coated and glossy, about 3 minutes.

10. Remove pot from heat and stir in shrimp and reserved parsley.

11. Cut **1 lemon** in half and squeeze juice into pot (it should be about 2 Tbsp.), stirring to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning for salt. Cut remaining lemon into wedges for serving.

12. Divide pasta among bowls. Drizzle with more olive oil. Top with reserved panko mixture. Serve with lemon wedges alongside.
